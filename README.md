# 🧠 Customer Financial Behavior Classification

This project aims to classify customers based on their **financial behavior** and **financial goals** using machine learning techniques.  
It supports financial institutions in understanding customer profiles to deliver more personalized and strategic financial services.

## 📌 Project Overview

We use real-world financial behavior indicators such as:
- Monthly Income  
- Savings Rate  
- Investment Preferences  
- Debt Ratio  
- Spending Habits  

To classify customers into three key segments:

- **Saver** – Focused on long-term financial security and saving money.  
- **Investor** – Interested in growing wealth through investments.  
- **Spender** – Prioritizes current consumption over long-term saving or investing.  

This segmentation enables better customer targeting and improved service personalization.

## 📈 Example Use Case

A financial institution wants to improve its customer outreach and product alignment by analyzing financial behavior.

Using this model, the bank can classify each customer as a **Saver**, **Investor**, or **Spender**, then tailor services such as:
- Savings plans  
- Retirement accounts  
- Investment portfolios  
- Budgeting tools
